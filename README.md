### Project Overview

 to be able to predict the compensation


### Learnings from the project

 Train-test split
Data Cleaning
Linear Regression & Regularization Techniques
R^2 Evaluation Metrics


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 First cleaned the data to handle all null values, after that converted all categorical data into numerical one by LabelEncoder. 
after doing EDA on data looked for outliers by various plots handled all the outliers. after that split that train data into test and train data and did R^2 evaluation metrics analysis, also applied polynomial feature of 2 degree to the data. 
did all of the above on the test data and did the final analysis and submitted the result.
